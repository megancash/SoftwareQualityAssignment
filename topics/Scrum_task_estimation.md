# **Task Estimation in SCRUM**
## **Introduction**
In this handbook we will investigate Task Estimation in Scrum. Scrum is an agile framework used in project management to help aid in accountability, teamwork, and iterative progress towards a well-defined goal. Overall, it helps contributors and teams deliver value incrementally in a collaborative way.

## **1. Scrum Task estimation Methods**
SCRUM task estimation of user stories is essentially rating the degree of difficulty got each user story in the project. There are several techniques that can be used to assess the degree of difficulty. Such as the following:

### **Planning Poker Technique**

This technique is widely used in SCRUM task estimation. When using the Planning Poker Technique , each team member use numbered cards to determine story points to user stories and determine each work items degree of complexity.  They take heavily into account expert’s opinions and previous experience to determine each item’s final estimation. This technique results in efficient and reliable estimates.

**Steps:**

1.  Each member is given an identical deck of cards, each with a different number. This will be used for each team member to reach a consensus number for each user story.
2.  Evaluate each user story.
3.  Discuss how the work will be completed, what complexities can arise and how much time needs to be allocated.
4.  Each member will use the cards to estimate each story point.
5.  Come to a mutual consensus for each user story. 

### **The Bucket System Estimation**
 
The Bucket System Estimation is used by dividing the ‘buckets’ based on their complexity. This technique allows the team to size many work items.

**Steps:**
1.  Choose a story item at random and place It in the ‘8’ bucket to be used as the first reference item.
2.  Then choose another story item at random and compare it to the reference item. Discuss as a team where its relative position on the scale would be and then place in the appropriate bucket. Repeat this step for all the items.
3.  Once completed, review all the items on the scale. Discuss with each team member to see if any changes need to be made.
4.  Ensure you know what bucket number is for each item , to make sure that each estimate is known and recorded.

### **T-Shirt Size Estimation Technique**
 
The T-Shirt Size Estimation is used by Scrum teams to estimate various work items in a project. Each item is estimated using t-shirt sizing’s such as XS, S, M, L, XL.  The sizes represent different complexities of user stories.

**Steps:**
1.  The team decides on what each t-shirt size represents.
2.  Each developer assigns each story a t-shirt size.
3.  The team will discuss with one another why they assigned the certain complexity. 
4.  The team will come to a consensus on their complexity of each user story.
5.  A time estimation is then concluded due to each t-shirt size.

**2. Scrum Task estimation tools**
 
Jira Software is an agile project management tool that supports agile methodologies such as scrum. Users can estimate stories in their product backlog to allow you to predict how long it would take you to deliver certain deliverables.

## **Task estimation advantages and disadvantages**

### **Advantages:**

- Allows for timeframe estimation for the completion of the      project or particular features.
- Can improve the team members estimating skills:
    This leads to better scrum estimation in future projects which ensures accuracy.
- Allows for distribution of tasks within the team
    This allows the team to be more efficient with their time, while also motivating the team members and allowing them to perform their designated tasks better.
- Sets goals for the sprint for each developer on the team and  aids in tracking the progress of the project
    The more you  monitor your progress towards a goal, this increases motivation among team members and allows them to reach realistic targets.
- Allows you to validate a user story: 
    Which works well for fast-moving development projects as it allows you to evaluate how  much work needs to be done in each user story and you can decide whether or not it can be delivered in a single sprint.
- Allows the team to review the sprint and create conclusions.


### **Disadvantages:**

- A team member may struggle to carry out required work for their tasks within the estimated time.
- A team member may lack task estimation skills.
- The project can fail if team members don’t communicate/ work well together.

## **3. Tips and best practices for Scrum task estimation**

How to improve the consistency and quality of your task estimates:

- Try to use different task estimation methods: 
  Its important to try multiple task estimation methods per each sprint to ensure more accuracy for the task estimates.
- Ensure good communication and teamwork skills are present within the team:
  It is important to ensure that all the team members work well together and communicate effectively to get a realistic task estimation of the project. It is vital in determining the task estimations that all team members discuss their point of views and listen to one another to ensure accuracy. 
- Break up large items into manageable tasks.
- Iterate and improve continuously:
  During retrospectives, continuously analyse and assess the progress the team is making, and make adjustments if needed.
- Ensure every team member gives an estimate:
  It is important to get each members point of view and this allows you to assess your resources within the team.
- If you have multiple small tasks, group them together and then estimate.
- No distractions during task estimation:
  Every team member must be completely focused on the tasks and the overall goal of the project to ensure realistic results for the Scrum.
