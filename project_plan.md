# **Project Plan**

## **What are the different tasks needed to complete the project:**
•   Megan created the repository and then we each will create a feature branch for each feature.

•   We arranged our first meeting to discuss each task and decide on the additional topic that we are going to include in the handbook.

•   We will then divide up the topics and create a plan of what days we will meet and what needs to be done for each meeting. 

•   For our second meeting, we will discuss what resources we found for each topic and go through them to ensure they were relevant to the topics.

•   When each member is finished a topic we will meet and discuss and push it to GitHub. All team members will give feedback on pull requests.

•   Group members will be able to pull if any adjustments need to be made.



## **Who will be working on each task:**

• **Task estimation in Scrum:** Megan & Devano
• **Code Reviews:** Devano & Rodney
• **Error Logging:** Rodney & Megan
