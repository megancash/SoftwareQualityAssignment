#  **Project Reflection**y

I feel like we all followed our project plan quite well. We had regular meetings where we would discuss what we were working on and hear each memberâ€™s point of view and adjustments on the topics. However, there is three things we would have done differently as a team such as:
-	During the project set up we could have had more preparation on getting familiar with git commands so that we could have used our time more efficiently.
-	To make sure to use feature branches initially rather than everyone creating their own branches.
-	The project plan could be more detailed in the specific steps we had to take.
